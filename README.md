# ERES V Github workshop

**Conveners:**
Ishan Mishra
Ryan Peterson
Bastien Brugger

## Description

Coding makes up a significant part of a researcherâ€™s time, yet scientists are known to have kept bad habits from early days of programming. The modern open-source community has developed tools and good practices for making software available and maintainable, useful for the reproducibility of studies required by scientific guidelines. This workshop will focus on GitHub, a code-hosting platform, to explain how version control systems work and can be used to improve the quality and quantity of programming among researchers. We will also go through other options offered by GitHub, such as creating your own website, and supplementary resources available within the open-source community.
