Why command line?
- Lots of command line centric tools (git, etc.). More powerful control than their GUI versions
- Standard syntax across platforms
- Online help; extensive documentations
- Excellent opportunity to learn what's really going on at low level

What is Shell?
- User interface that allows interacting with the computer's resources like files and folders. 
- Text-only shells (as compared to graphical shells like Windows) are commonly referred to as *command line* interpreters.  
- Bash is the default command line interpreter on MacOS and most Linux distributions. 
- Bash is also a rudimentary programming/scripting language
- More expressive than Windows command shell
- Git Bash is a nice Bash shell environment in Windows; free and open source; comes installed with git
