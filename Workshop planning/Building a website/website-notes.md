### Helpful notes for GitHub website content:

- Talk about both user/organization pages (separate repository  & URL is `<your user-name>.github.io`) and individual project pages (same repository as the project & URL is `<your user-name>.github.io/<your repositoryâ€™s name>`

-Why Github Pages?
  - Free to host service
  - can also use custom url
  - Gives you complete control over the look of the website (need to know some CSS, HTML, etc.)
  
Jonathan McGlone, author of a couple of very useful blogs on using GitHub pages (http://jmcglone.com/notes/2014/05/03/using-github-to-create-and-host-a-personal-website), preferes the GitHub + Jekyll setup because of its:

- simplicity
- good performance and reliability
- no databases
- hosting to be free or really cheap
- a custom domain
- the ability to work on my site from anywhere if needed
- to use open source tools supported by an active development community
- to get up and running quickly
- to have version control on my website, preferably Git
- to be able to share my code so others can easily re-use it
