3. Enter the project folder and add a simple index.html file: `echo "Hello world" > index.html`
4. Add, commit, and push your changes: <br>
  `git add --all` <br>
  `git commit -m "Inital commit"` <br>
  `git push -u origin master` <br>
5. Fire up a browser and go to https://username.github.io.

Three sample websites:

1. Simple website with markdown pages and jekyll used for styling. Point to resources for modifying the Jekyll theme/adding your own css content
2. Simple website with HTML pages and jekyll used for styling. 
3. Simple website with HTML pages and your own css files for styling. Point to https://templated.co for prebuilt HTML/CSS templates. No need to master HTML/CSS. Natasha's website as an example.
